**DEtailwindizer - Remove tailwind css from your code**
DEtailwindizer is an essential tool for every project which uses tailwind css. DEtailwindizer will convert ridiculous inline tailwind styles into proper css named elements. Just get rid of this nightmare!

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Development

```
npm run start
```

will start project on localhost:8000

## Disclaimer

This project was made in a few hours, just for fun and its not intended for any serious usage. There are a lot of issues starting from how html is parsed. It will not work for any serious code, especially which is more complicated than example templates on tailwind website.

As i might not be a fan of tailwind's approach to css, I respect their work and opinions and created detailwinder just for pure fun, so please don't take it personally/too seriously.
